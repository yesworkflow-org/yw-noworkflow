YesWorkflow-NoWorkflow Bridge
=============================

# Overview

The yw-noworkflow repository contains experimental code that explores how the complementary provenance 
information provided by [YesWorkflow](https://github.com/yesworkflow-org/yw-prototypes/tree/master) and [NoWorkflow](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow) can be used together to yield visualizations and 
query results that neither can provide on its own.

# Installation

YesWorkflow-NoWorkflow Bridge requires the installation of both YesWorkflow and NoWorkflow, in order to perform XSB Prolog and SQL queries.

## YesWorkflow

YesWorkflow is a scientific workflow management system that extracts YW commends that users add to scripts that reveal the computational modules and the dataflow, render graphical output that reveals the stages of computation and the flow of data in the script, and store the prospective provenance of the data products of scripts. 

YesWorkflow installation details and instructions can be found in [yw-prototype repository](https://github.com/yesworkflow-org/yw-prototypes).

Note that this demonstration requires **YesWorkflow 0.2.1**.The latest version of YesWorkflow can be obtained from:
```
    https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bamboo/browse/KURATOR-YSF/latestSuccessful
```
Click the Artifacts tab, then download the executable jar. The file will be named yesworkflow-0.2.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar. You can also find the executable jar in the [releases page](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/releases).

You may also want to define an alias to simplify running YesWorkflow at the command line.

If you have saved yesworkflow-0.2.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar to the bin subdirectory of your home directory, the following command will create a bash alias for running YesWorkflow simply by typing yw:
```
alias yw='java -jar ~/bin/yesworkflow-0.2.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar'
```
On Windows the command to create the yw macro is:

```
doskey yw=java -jar %USERPROFILE%\bin\yesworkflow-0.2.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar $*
```

## NoWorkflow

NoWorkflow collects provenance for Python scripts into SQLite database. It could show provenance of a trial, compare the collected provenance of different trials, visualize the dataflow, and perform Prolog and SQL queries.

NoWorkflow installation details and instructions can be found in [noWorkflow repository](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow).

## XSB Prolog and SQLite

XSB is a Logic Programming system for Unix and Windows-based platforms. SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library, and is an embedded SQL database engine. YesWorkflow-NoWorkflow Bridge will use XSB and SQLite to define rules for YesWorkflow, NoWorkflow, and the bridge, and perform queries for them. 

You can find instructions for installing XSB at [XSB Website](http://xsb.sourceforge.net/), or on [the Github page](https://github.com/flavioc/XSB).

## SQLite

Go to [SQLite download page](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html), and download precompiled binaries.

If you are on a Linux or Mac OS X machine, it probably is pre-installed with SQLite. Check if you already have SQLite installed on your machine or not.
```
$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.

# Usage

We will use simulate_data_collection as an example to show how to use YesWorkflow-NoWorkflow Bridge. simulate_data_collection.py simulates acquisition of diffraction images during macromolecular X-ray crystallography experiments involving multiple samples. The script reads previously measured data quality statistics for each sample from an input spreadsheet; rejects samples that do not meet a minimum quality criterion; and for each accepted sample produces raw and corrected diffraction images according to a data collection strategy that depends on properties of the samples. It takes two input files, [cassette_q55_spreadsheet.csv](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/cassette_q55_spreadsheet.csv) and [calibration.img](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/calibration.img). The output files are generated in [run](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/tree/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/run) folder. 




Go to simulate_data_collection example folder:
```
    cd yw-noworkflow/examples/simulate_data_collection/
```

If you would like to reproduce the results through this demo, you can remove all derived files:

```
    rm -rf facts graph query/*query_outputs.txt .noworkflow *.txt df_style.py
```

### Example YesWorkflow output

The image below was produced by YesWorkflow using the YW comments added to simulate_data_collection python script ([simulate_data_collection.py](https://github.com/yesworkflow-org/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/simulate_data_collection.py)):

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/graph/yw_combined_graph.png" height="500"></p>

The green blocks represent stages in the computation performed by the script, the yellow blocks represent the input, intermediate, and final data products of the script, and the white blocks are parameters used for the script.

### Example NoWorkflow output

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/graph/nw_filtered_lineage_graph.png" height="500"></p>

The white blocks are input and output data, the dark blue blocks represents computational stages, and blue-green blocks represent parameter names and their values.

## Generate visualizations and query results with Prolog

### Generate facts and views from YesWorkflow

1. First, create a new folder that will store YesWorkflow facts (and NoWorkflow facts later):
    ```
    mkdir facts
    ```

1. Then run YesWorkflow for the python script `simulate_data_collection.py` marked with YW annotation through command:

    ```
    java -jar ~/bin/yesworkflow-0.2.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar model simulate_data_collection.py \
        -c extract.language=python -c extract.factsfile=facts/yw_extract_facts.P \
        -c model.factsfile=facts/yw_model_facts.P -c query.engine=xsb
    ```

  If you've defined the alias for YesWorkflow, you can simply run:

    ```
    yw model simulate_data_collection.py -c extract.language=python -c extract.factsfile=facts/yw_extract_facts.P \
    -c model.factsfile=facts/yw_model_facts.P -c query.engine=xsb
    ```

  In this command, `model` means building the workflow model from YW comments in the source script. `extract.language=python` specifies the language used in the source file. `extract.factsfile` and `model.factsfile` specifies the locations to save the facts for the source script and the model. `query.engine=xsb` represents the output query language to be XSB. 

  We now get the facts from the YW markup in the source script, and the corresponding models, such as annotations, ports, channels, uri template, etc. You can check these facts in [yw_extract_facts.P](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/facts/yw_extract_facts.P) and [yw_model_facts.P](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/facts/yw_model_facts.P) file in [facts](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/tree/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/facts) folder.

1. Then generate yw_views from  the facts:

  [yw_views](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/views/yw_views.P) are views derived from facts. It organizes the yw facts in such a way that can be reused by our YesWorkflow-NoWorkflow Bridge later, and can be easily queried.

        
        mkdir views
        bash ../../scripts/materialize_yw_views.sh > views/yw_views.P
        

### Create facts and views from NoWorkflow

1. First, run python source script through NoWorkflow:

    ```
    # empty the noworkflow record
    rm -rf .noworkflow
    # run the script
    now run -e Tracer -d 3 simulate_data_collection.py q55 --cutoff 12 --redundancy 0 > run_outputs.txt
    ```

  `now run` specifies the source script to run and collects its provenance. `-e Tracer` tag means NoWorkflow captures variables, dependencies, function calls, parameters, file accesses, and globals. `-d 3` tag represents the depth for capturing function activations is 3, for the sake of the running time. `simulate_data_collection.py q55 --cutoff 12 --redundancy 0` is the source script name and its corresponding input arguments. The output of the script is written to the `run_outputs.txt` file.

  By running NoWorkflow, it automatically creates a SQLite database under `.noworkflow` folder. 

1. We want to extract Prolog facts through NW command `export`:
    
    ```    
    now export -t -m dependency | grep -v 'environment(' > facts/nw_facts.P
    ```    

1. Then generate [nw_views](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/views/nw_views.P) from `nw_facts`, same as we did for YesWorkflow:

    ```    
    bash ../../scripts/materialize_nw_views.sh > views/nw_views.P
    ```    

### Create views for YW-NW

YW-NW is created by combining blocks and parameters defined by YesWorkflow and corresponding parameters, value, and functions captured by NoWorkflow. Run the command to generate [yw_nw_views](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/views/yw_nw_views.P):

    
    bash ../../scripts/materialize_yw_nw_views.sh > views/yw_nw_views.P
    

### Perform YW, NW, YW-NW queries

Run the queries in query/query.sh and confirm that the answers make sense.

    
    bash query/query.sh > query/query_outputs.txt
    

  - Sample YesWorkflow query:

    - What workflow steps comprise the top-level workflow?

    ```
    yw_q2(StepName, Description)
    ...................................................................................................
    yw_q2(log_average_image_intensity,'Record statistics about each diffraction image.').
    yw_q2(transform_images,'Correct raw image using the detector calibration image.').
    yw_q2(collect_data_set,'Collect data set using the given data collection parameters.').
    yw_q2(log_rejected_sample,'Record which samples were rejected.').
    yw_q2(calculate_strategy,'Reject unsuitable crystals and compute best data sets to collect for accepted crystals.').
    yw_q2(load_screening_results,'Load sample information from spreadsheet.').
    yw_q2(initialize_run,'Create run directory and initialize log files.').
    ```

  - Sample NoWorkflow query:

    - What variable values are passed to transform_image(...) from the top of the script?

    ```
    nw_q2(Variable, Value)
    ...................................................................................................
    nw_q2(calibration_image_file,'calibration.img').
    nw_q2(raw_image_file,'run/raw/q55/DRT240/e10000/image_001.raw').
    nw_q2(raw_image_file,'run/raw/q55/DRT322/e10000/image_001.raw').
    nw_q2(raw_image_file,'run/raw/q55/DRT240/e11000/image_002.raw').
    nw_q2(raw_image_file,'run/raw/q55/DRT322/e10000/image_002.raw').
    nw_q2(raw_image_file,'run/raw/q55/DRT240/e12000/image_001.raw').
    nw_q2(raw_image_file,'run/raw/q55/DRT322/e11000/image_001.raw').
    nw_q2(raw_image_file,'run/raw/q55/DRT240/e12000/image_002.raw').
    nw_q2(raw_image_file,'run/raw/q55/DRT240/e10000/image_002.raw').
    nw_q2(raw_image_file,'run/raw/q55/DRT322/e11000/image_002.raw').
    nw_q2(raw_image_file,'run/raw/q55/DRT240/e11000/image_001.raw').
    ```

  - Sample Yes-No Workflow query:

    - What Python variables carries values of sample_name into the calculate_strategy workflow step?

    ```
    yw_nw_q1(VariableId, VariableName, VariableValue)
    ...................................................................................................
    yw_nw_q1(255,sample_name,'DRT110').
    yw_nw_q1(361,sample_name,'DRT240').
    yw_nw_q1(2511,sample_name,'DRT322').
    ```

### Generate YW, NW, YW-NW visualizations

#### Graphics from YesWorkflow
YesWorkflow can render three types of different views of the workflow structure from the model we built before:  a process view, a data view, and a combined (data + process) view.

We can render these views through the following commands:

We first create a new folder to contain all the visualization rendered by YW, NW, and YW-NW.
    
    mkdir graph
    
Then generate graphs as `gv` files, the file format used by Graphviz:

    bash ../../scripts/yw_data_graph.sh > graph/yw_data_graph.gv
    bash ../../scripts/yw_process_graph.sh > graph/yw_process_graph.gv
    bash ../../scripts/yw_combined_graph.sh > graph/yw_combined_graph.gv

Render the pdf/png format file through Graphviz:
    ```
    # pdf files
    dot -Tpdf graph/yw_data_graph.gv -o graph/yw_data_graph.pdf
    dot -Tpdf graph/yw_process_graph.gv -o graph/yw_process_graph.pdf
    dot -Tpdf graph/yw_combined_graph.gv -o graph/yw_combined_graph.pdf
    
    #png files
    dot -Tpng graph/yw_data_graph.gv -o graph/yw_data_graph.png
    dot -Tpng graph/yw_process_graph.gv -o graph/yw_process_graph.png
    dot -Tpng graph/yw_combined_graph.gv -o graph/yw_combined_graph.png
    ```    
You can checkout the resulting images here:

yw_data_graph.png:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/graph/yw_data_graph.png" height="250"></p>

yw_process_graph.png: 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/graph/yw_process_graph.png" height="250"></p>

yw_combined_graph.png: 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/graph/yw_combined_graph.png" height="500"></p>

YesWorkflow can also generate workflow from prospective provenance. You can render the visualization for the lineage of a specific output data product.


For example, if we're interested in which steps and data products result in the "corrected image" in the simulate_data_collection, we can use the following command:

    ```
    bash ../../scripts/yw_prospective_lineage.sh \
    corrected_image > graph/yw_prospective_lineage.gv

    # generate pdf and png files
    dot -Tpng graph/yw_prospective_lineage.gv -o graph/yw_prospective_lineage.png
    dot -Tpdf graph/yw_prospective_lineage.gv -o graph/yw_prospective_lineage.pdf
    ```

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/graph/yw_prospective_lineage.png" height="500"></p>

Compare this graph with the [yw_combined_graph](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/graph/yw_combined_graph.png) above. The [yw_prospective_lineage graph](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/graph/yw_prospective_lineage.png) is a "subset" of the yw_combined_graph. See if the dataflow makes sense to you.

#### Graphics from NoWorkflow

Just as YesWorkflow can query for the lineage for an output data product, NoWorkflow can also do the similar thing. NoWorkflow is able to filter the dataflow by a variable/file name, and create the lineage graph for that variable/file name.

    ```
    # create df_style helper that can be used to change noWorkflow graph style
    now helper df_style.py

    # export filtered noWorkflow simulation graph with depth 2
    now dataflow -d 2 -v 55 -f 'run/data/DRT240/DRT240_11000eV_002.img' -m simulation | python df_style.py -d BT -e > graph/nw_filtered_lineage_graph.gv

    # generate pdf and png files
    dot -Tpng graph/nw_filtered_lineage_graph.gv -o graph/nw_filtered_lineage_graph.png
    dot -Tpdf graph/nw_filtered_lineage_graph.gv -o graph/nw_filtered_lineage_graph.pdf
    ```
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/graph/nw_filtered_lineage_graph.png" height="500"></p>

#### Graphics from YesWorkflow-NoWorkflow Bridge

This lineage graph of a specific output data from YesWorkflow-NoWorkflow Bridge is constructed as a subgraph of the original YW model, and has data values captured by NW retrospective provenance. So if we visualize the lineage graph of an actual output data with YW-NW graph, which corresponds to the same data defined with YW comment, the graph structure of this YW-NW graph should be same as the YW prospective lineage graph, but with actual data values that used to produce the output data in the YW-NW graph.

```
    bash ../../scripts/yw_nw_retrospective_lineage.sh \
    corrected_image 'run/data/DRT240/DRT240_11000eV_002.img' \
    > graph/yw_nw_retrospective_lineage.gv

    # generate pdf and png files
    dot -Tpdf graph/yw_nw_retrospective_lineage.gv -o graph/yw_nw_retrospective_lineage.pdf
    dot -Tpng graph/yw_nw_retrospective_lineage.gv -o graph/yw_nw_retrospective_lineage.png
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/graph/yw_nw_retrospective_lineage.png" height="500"></p>

## Perform query with SQLite on YesWorkflow, NoWorkflow and YesWorkflow-NoWorkflow Bridge

Similar to how we perform query with Prolog, we will run the script with YesWorkflow and NoWorkflow store **views** for YesWorkflow, NoWorkflow, and YesWorkflow-NoWorkflow Bridge on the database, and then perform SQLite queries on the database.

1. Generate facts and views from YesWorkflow

  - Run YesWorkflow with query.engine set as "csv", and designate the location to save facts in csv format:
    
        yw model simulate_data_collection.py -c extract.language=python \
        -c extract.factsfile=csv/extractfacts -c model.factsfile=csv/modelfacts \
        -c query.engine=csv
    

  - Input all the csv facts into SQL database:

    
        sqlite3 facts/yw_facts.db < ../../scripts/yw_facts.sql
    

  - Check the results in `yw_facts.db`, and then quit SQLite3 by typing `.exit` or ^D. :

        ```    
        $ sqlite3 facts/yw_facts.db

        SQLite version 3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19
        Enter ".help" for usage hints.

        sqlite> .tables
        extractfacts_annotation                 modelfacts_log_template               
        extractfacts_annotation_qualifies       modelfacts_outflow_connects_to_channel
        extractfacts_extract_source             modelfacts_port                       
        modelfacts_channel                      modelfacts_port_alias                 
        modelfacts_data                         modelfacts_port_connects_to_channel   
        modelfacts_function                     modelfacts_port_uri_template          
        modelfacts_has_in_port                  modelfacts_program                    
        modelfacts_has_out_port                 modelfacts_uri_variable               
        modelfacts_has_subprogram               modelfacts_workflow                   
        modelfacts_inflow_connects_to_channel 
        ```

  - Create views for YesWorkflow:

    
        sqlite3 views/yw_views.db < ../../scripts/yw_views.sql 
    

  - Check the results in `yw_views.db`:

        ```    
        sqlite3 views/yw_views.db

        SQLite version 3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19
        Enter ".help" for usage hints.

        sqlite> .tables

        yw_inflow            yw_source_file     
        ```

1. Generate facts and views from NoWorkflow

  - Run NoWorkflow, and copy the records to the [facts](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/tree/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/facts) folder:

        ```
        # empty the noworkflow record
        rm -rf .noworkflow
        # run the script with noworkflow
        now run -e Tracer -d 3 simulate_data_collection.py q55 --cutoff 12 --redundancy 0 > run_outputs.txt
        cp .noworkflow/db.sqlite facts/nw_facts.db
        ```
    

  - Create views for NoWorkflow:

    
        sqlite3 views/nw_views.db < ../../scripts/nw_views.sql 
    

  - Check the results in `nw_views.db`:


        ```
        sqlite3 views/nw_views.db

        SQLite version 3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19
        Enter ".help" for usage hints.

        nw_script_activation           usage              
        ```    

1. Generate views from YewWorkflow-NoWorkflow Bridge. This requires [yw_views.db](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/views/yw_views.P) and [nw_views.db](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/views/nw_views.P)

    
        sqlite3 views/yw_nw_views.db < ../../scripts/yw_nw_views.sql 

    
  - Check the results in `yw_nw_views.db`:


        ```
        $ sqlite3 views/yw_nw_views.db          

        SQLite version 3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19

1. Perform queries for YW, NW, and YW-NW

    
    python query/yw_extract_query.py > query/yw_extract_query_outputs.txt
    python query/yw_model_query.py > query/yw_model_query_outputs.txt
    python query/yw_nw_query.py > query/yw_nw_query_outputs.txt

  Note that not all the questions have an answer, because some questions are not appliable to the script. For now, only simulate_data_collection example has an exhausted yw_extract_query and yw_model_query.
    
  Check the output, see if the results in [yw_extract_query_outputs.txt](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/query/yw_extract_query_outputs.txt) and [yw_model_query_outputs.txt](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/query/yw_model_query_outputs.txt) make sense to you, and the results in [yw_nw_query_outputs.txt](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/query/yw_nw_query_outputs.txt) is same as the answers for `yw-nw` in [query_outputs.txt](https://github.com/idaks/yw-noworkflow/blob/master/examples/simulate_data_collection/query/query_outputs.txt).
